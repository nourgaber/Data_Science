This project is the first project in data science nano-degree from Udacity.

In this project, I use data provided by Motivate,
 a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States.
 I compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

To run the project run in cmd:
 python3 bikeshare.py

 The output is the following statistics:
 -Analysis the start time to get:
  -Most common hour
  -Most common Month
  -Most common day_name
-Analysis the trip_duration to get:
  -Total travel time
  -Mean travel time
-Analysis the start and end stations to get:
  -Most commonly used start station
  -Most commonly used end station
  -Most frequent combination of start station and end station
-Analysis the User stats to get:
  -Counts of user types
  -Earliest, most recent, and most common year of birth
